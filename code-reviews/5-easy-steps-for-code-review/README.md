### Why Review Code?

- Best practices / Consistency
- Educate others on the new code
- Reduces "Bus Factor" -> other people should also know more
- Allows for discussions
  

### Five Easy Steps 

1- What is the code doing?
  * understand the context
  * Do you have the right background info?
  * Do you full understand why this code is needed?
  * Do you understand how this code fits into the project?

2- Frame you mind
  * How experienced are you with the codebase/language?
  * Are you going to be using this code in the future?
  * Have you written code similar to this?
  * What is the experience level of the author?
  * What is your relationship with the author?

3- Test the code
  * Does the code generate warnings/errors?
  * Does the code take longer than normal to build/run?
  * Do the changes require any additional setup step?
  * Run the UI code and try to break it and find something

4- Inspect the code
  * Are correct naming conventions followed?
  * Does the code follow DRY principles?
  * Are new files/folders named appropriately?
  * Does the code have error handling?
  * Is the code written in a similar style to other code in project?

5- Compile your review
  * Beware of bikeshedding ->
  * Be respectful
  * Be specific and descriptive
  * Be open to follow-ups
