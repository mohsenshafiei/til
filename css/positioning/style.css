/* 
The position property changes how an element behaves in the normal
flow of the document, and how it relates to other elements. The available options are
relative, absolute, fixed and sticky with the default value being static.
*/


/* 

Adding position: relative to an element also makes it the
containing block of any child elements with position: absolute.

This means that its child will now be repositioned to this particular
element, instead of the topmost relative parent, when it has an absolute position
applied to it.
*/
.my-element {
  position: relative;
  top: 10px;
}



/* 
When you set position to absolute, it breaks the element
out of the current document flow.

This means two things:

1- You can position this element wherever you like, using top, right
bottom and left in its nearest relative parent.

2- All of the content surrounding an absolute element reflows to fill the
remaining space left by that element.

*/

/* 
An element with a position fixed behaves in a similar way to absolute, with its
parent being the root <html> element. Fixed position elements stay anchored from the top
left based on the top right bottom and left values that set.
*/

/* 
Flexbox and grid have special wrapping features and they don't wrap their children by default.
