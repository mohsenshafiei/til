/* 
Filters in CSS mean that you can apply effects you might only think possible
in a graphic application.

filter properties:

blur(<how_much_blur_you_want>)
brightness(<percentage>)
contrast(<percentage>)
grayscale(<percentage>)
invert(<1 or 0 to turn off and on>)
opacity(<percentage>)
saturate(<percentage>)
sepia(<percentage>)
hue-rotate(<>)
drop-shadow -> drop-shadow(5px 5px 10px orange);
url -> allows you to apply an SVG filter from a linked SVG element or file

The backdrop-filter property accepts all of the same filter function values
as filter. The difference between backdrop-filter and filter is that the 
backdrop-filter property only applies the filter to the background where the
filter property applies it to the whole element.
