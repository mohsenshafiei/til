/* 
Some CSS properties are inheritable
*/

/* 
How inheritance works?

Every HTML element has every CSS property defined by default
with an initial value. An initial value is a property that is not
inherited and shows up as a default if the cascade fails to calculate
a value for that element.
*/

/* 
Properties that can be inherited cascade downwards, and each elements
will get a computed value which represents its parent's value.
*/


/* 
You can make any property inherit its parent's computed value
witht the inherit.
*/

/* 
The initial keyword sets a property back to that initial, default value.
*/

/* 
The `unset` property behaves differently if a property is inheritable or not.
If a property is inheritable, the unset keyword will be the same as inherit. If
the property is not inheritable, the unset keyword is equal to initial.
