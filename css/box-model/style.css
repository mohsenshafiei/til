/* Everything displayed by CSS is a box. */

/* Boxes are made up of distinct box model areas that all do a specific job. */

/* We have content-box, padding-box, border-box, margin-box */

/* 
If our box has overflow rules set, such as overflow: auto or overflow: scroll,
the scrollbars will occupy this space too.
*/

/* 
Properties such as outline and box-shadow occupy, margin-box and because they are
painted on top, so they don't affect the size of our box. You could have an 
outline-width of 200px and everything would be exactly the same size.
*/

/* 
To understand the box model it is better to know that each browser applies a user
agent stylesheet to HTML documents. The CSS used varies between each browser, but
they provide sensible defaults to make content easier to read.
*/

/* 
By default, all the elements have the following user agent style: box-sizing: content-box
*/

/* 
Having content-box as the value of box-sizing means that when you set dimensions,
such as a width and height, they will be applied to the content box. If you 
then set padding and border, these values will be added to the content box's size.
*/


/* 
to reset all the user agent style and make the styling more predictable use below code:
*/

*,
*::before,
*::after {
  box-sizing: border-box;
}
