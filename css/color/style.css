/* 
There are differnt ways for defining color in your style
*/

/* 
Different ways of color defining are:


1- Numerical Color:

#ffffff is white
#000000 is black

2- RGB (Red, Green, Blue)

rgb(0, 0, 0) is black
rgb(255, 255, 255) is white
rgb(255, 255, 255, 0.5) we can change opacity 

3- HSL (Hue, Satuation, Lightness)

imagine a circle with different color like below: 

orange(0) -> 
yellow (60) -> 
green(120) -> 
cyan(180) -> 
blue(240) -> 
purple(300) -> 
red(330) ->
orange

Saturation is how vibrant is the color
A full desaturated color (with a saturation of 0%) will appear grayscale.

Lightness is the parameter which describes thte scale from white
to black of added light

A lightness of 100% will always give you white

hsl(0, 0%, 0%)
hsl(0deg, 0%, 0%)
hsl(0turn, 0%, 0%)
hsla(0, 0%, 0%, 0.5) -> this is adding alpha

4- Color Keywords
There are 148 named colors in CSS
*/


/* 
Aside from standard colors, there are also special keywords available

- transparent -> is default background

- currentColor -> it gets color based on the font color

Note: If the element that you define currentColor on does not have
a value for color defined, currentColor will be computed by the cascade instead.
