/* 
Pseudo-elements

A peeudo-element is like adding or targeting an extra element without having to add
more HTML.

There are limited properties that you can add to different pseudo-elements.

::before
::after

Note: you can only insert a ::before or ::after element
to an element that will accept child elements. so elements such as <img /> and 
<video>, <button> and <input > won't work.

::first-letter
::first-line


::backdrop

if you have an element that is presented in full screen mode, such as
dialog or a video you can style the backdrop.

::backdrop pseudo-element is supported in all major browsers apart from safari.

the backdrop style used when a video is shifted to full-screen mode is configured
to be a grey-blue color rather than the black it defaults to in most browsers.

::marker -> pseudo-element lets you style the bullet or number 
for a list item or the arrow of a <summary> element.

::selection -> allows you to style how selected text looks

::placeholder

::cue -> This allows you to style the WebVTT cues, which are the captions of a <video> element.



While DevTools may show pseudo-elements in the Elements panel, 
pseudo-elements won't be found in the HTML, they're owned by the browser.

They can be targeted by CSS but won't be found in the HTML.
